# Dryer Dimension Optimization Using Machine Learning

## The Objective of the project is to Correctly Predict optimal dimensions for a hollow cylindrical dryer given some weight(the capacity of dryer desired by the client) under the stress constrain(stress<200Psa) which can be useful for cost reduction.
## Note:The stress is a simulated value i.e the max stress the dryer can handle without breaking/damage from all points on the dryer hence not derived by any formula !!!
